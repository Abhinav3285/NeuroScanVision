🔷 OVERALL PROJECT DESCRIPTION (FINAL)
🔹 Project Title

YOLOv8-Based Multi-Class Brain Tumor Detection and Localization from MRI Images with Web Application Support

1️⃣ What is my project?

This project aims to detect, classify, and localize brain tumors from MRI images using YOLOv8, an advanced deep-learning object detection model.

The system:

Accepts MRI images as input

Detects tumor regions

Classifies tumor type (multi-class)

Displays bounding boxes with confidence scores

Provides a web-based interface using Streamlit, inspired by a smart healthcare system

2️⃣ What BASE PAPER idea am I using?

From the base paper, I use:

MRI-based brain tumor diagnosis

Deep learning for medical imaging

Smart healthcare workflow (upload → process → result)

3️⃣ What did I CHANGE from the base paper?
🔁 CNN → YOLOv8

Base paper uses CNN for classification

I replaced CNN with YOLOv8 for:

Object detection

Tumor localization

Multi-class classification

🔁 Binary → Multi-Class

Instead of tumor / no tumor

I classify:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary tumor

🔁 No CNN Baseline

I do NOT use CNN baseline

Reason: CNN cannot localize tumors

YOLOv8 alone satisfies project objective

4️⃣ What did I ADD to make the project stronger?

YOLOv8 object detection

Multi-class tumor classification

Bounding box visualization

Modular project structure

Streamlit-based web application

Clean separation of data, model, app, and results

5️⃣ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Domain: Medical Imaging, Deep Learning

Frameworks/Libraries:

ultralytics

PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy

Streamlit

Dataset: Brain MRI images (YOLO-formatted)

9️⃣ ONE-PARAGRAPH FINAL SUMMARY (REPORT-READY)

This project implements a YOLOv8-based multi-class brain tumor detection and localization system using MRI images. Inspired by a deep learning-based smart healthcare framework, the system replaces traditional CNN classifiers with an advanced object detection model to accurately identify tumor presence, type, and location. The project is organized into modular components for data handling, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and web deployment, enabling scalable and interpretable medical image analysis.
